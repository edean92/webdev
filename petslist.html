  <h3>Welcome to my very long list of pets I've had</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cali the calico cat</li>
    <li>Tia the maine coon cat</li>
    <li>My first fish tank made out of a 2 Liter bottle in first grade</li>
    <li>My second fish tank</li>
    <li>All of the snails in said fish tank when we learned our only snail was pregnant....seriously....there were like 100 at one point.</li>
    <li>Mocha the chocolate lab</li>
    <li>The hundreds of poor little lady bugs, roly polies, and fuzzy caterpillars I collected in plastic bins</li>
    <li>The thousands of poor little guppies,sand fleas, sand dollars, and star fish I collected in beach pails</li>
    <li>Snowball the bunny</li>
    <li>Bailey Joy the chocolate lab</li>
    <li>Zoe "Mittens" the fluffy, stray, tuxedo kitty who was totally my spirit animal</li>
    <li>Bruster Hot Fudge Sundae the discount mutant papillion with one floppy ear and triple the average size</li>
    <li>Gizmo the overly confident papillion</li>
    <li>A horse named Chance. He was a beautiful 17 hand paint</li>
    <li>Lola the 3 legged hamster who was just trying to do her best until she strangled herself on a string she chewed loose from a sock after a friend and I had to smoke her out with insense from under the bathroom vanity where she
      disappeared....RIP my little warrior</li>
    <li>baby mouse 1,2,and 3 we rescued and raised from the tornado-destroyed nest then released into the wild in the washcloth pouch I sewed for them that probably totally gave away their hiding spot to predators</li>
    <li>The hundreds of sea monkeys I tried to rescue by scraping at the carpet after mittens knocked them over</li>
    <li>Feesh the zombie beta fish</li>
    <li>Lady Honey "Bun" of Fluffington palace whom I snuck in the telemetry room at work for my whole 12 hour shift and talked a custodian into helping sneak her cage out in a rolling trash can</li>
    <li>"Butters" Scotch, the most chill bunny ever with the cutest little ears whose face looks like he ran into a wall</li>
    <li>"Cotton" Flufflestiltskin, he's pretty dumb and tempermental, but gosh is he cute and boy, was he traumatized in his past home...</li>
    <li>Smoky, the dumpster kitty</li>
    <li>Rheia Sunshine, the most badass yet, anxiety-filled baby</li>
    <li>About 1,000 other animals who became temporary pets until their owners were found.</li>
    <li>I have a problem.</li>
    <li>But, they're so darn cute.</li>
